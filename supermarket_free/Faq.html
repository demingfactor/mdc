          business.</p>
        <h4> Farmers Markets </h4>

        <h4> Grow your own </h4>
        <p>Pull your green finger out! From balcony planter pots, to backyard veggies beds to community garden plots, growing your own is a great way to get in touch with what your eating and what is in season.</p>

        <h2 class="py-4 font-bold">Won’t I be spending more money during my Supermarket Free Month?</h2>
        <p>
          Shopping at your local Farmers Market will definitely see you pocketing some mighty fresh and delicious produce. It is highly likely that the cost per kilo is similar or in many cases lower than the ‘Big Super’ prices. You’ll be getting freshly picked
          produce- usually picked the day before the market, superb quality and you’ll make some new friends on your journey. Supermarkets often have products as loss leaders, which are products selling for a very low margin, which encourages shoppers into
          the store, with the hope they will buy many more products at higher margins. You may save some money on great local bulk boxes of produce, joining a food co-op, planting your garden, using seasonal produce, more food from scratch… the savings are
          endless. All it takes is a little re-thinking and a bit of organising. We will help you out by providing you tips along the way.

        <h2 class="py-4 font-bold">So what about Foodland and IGA stores?</h2>
        <p>
          Can I shop there during my Supermarket Free challenge? Well this challenge is all about changing habits. Simply moving from the Big Supers to a more local supermarket is great for sharing our dollar to a locally owned option, but really it isn’t changing
            the way you shop. For this month try your hardest not to shop at a supermarket at all.

        <h2 class="py-4 font-bold">I'll try my best but what happens if I fall off the wagon?</h2>
        <p>
          Changing habits is a tough job! Hang in there! If you fall off the wagon, get back on straight away, you can control your future, you can't do much about the past. Reflect a little about it, but don't beat yourself up, just keep movin' on! We'd encourage
            you to post your 'incident' and your reflection on the Facebook group and you will find lots of support!
